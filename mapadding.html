    <center><h1><u>Vignère Cipher</u></h1></center>
    <p class="STYLE1">The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting messages by using 
        a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a 
        particular keyword. The Vigenère cipher is more powerful than 
        a single Caesar cipher and is much harder to crack.</p>
        <h1 align="center"><u>Kasiski Examination</u></h1>
    <p class="STYLE2">In cryptanalysis, Kasiski examination (also referred to as Kasiski's
         test or Kasiski's method) is a method of attacking polyalphabetic substitution ciphers,
          such as the Vigenère cipher. It was first published by Friedrich Kasiski in 1863,
           but seems to have been independently discovered by Charles Babbage as early as 1846. </p>
