    <p id="id1">
        Kerckhoffs's principle is one of the basic principles of modern cryptography.
        It was formulated in the end of the nineteenth century by Dutch cryptographer Auguste Kerckhoffs.
        The principle goes as follows: A cryptographic system should be secure even if everything
        about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.
